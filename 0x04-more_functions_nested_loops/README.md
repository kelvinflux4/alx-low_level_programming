#task 0
requires me to write a task that checks for uppercase characters
Prototype: int _isupper(int c);

Returns 1 if c is uppercase

Returns 0 otherwise
#task 1
requires me to write a function that checks for digits 0 though 9
Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);

Returns 1 if c is a digit

Returns 0 otherwise
#task 2
requires me to write a function that multiplies two integers
Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);
#task 3
requires me to write a function that prints the numbers 0 through 9
Prototype: void print_numbers(void);

You can only use _putchar twice in your code
#task 4
requires me to write a functon that prints numbers from 0 through 9 followed by a new line
Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);

Do not print 2 and 4

You can only use _putchar twice in your code
#task 5
requires me to write a function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14
Prototype: void more_numbers(void);

You can only use _putchar three times in your code
#task 6
requires me to write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal
Prototype: void print_line(int n);

You can only use _putchar function to print

Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed

The line should end with a \n

If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n
#task 7
requires me to write a function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal
Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);

You can only use _putchar function to print

Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed

The diagonal should end with a \n

If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n
#task 8
requires me to write a function that prints a square
Prototype: void print_square(int size);

You can only use _putchar function to print

Where size is the size of the square

If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line

Use the character # to print the square
#task 9
requires me to write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz
Each number or word should be separated by a space
You are allowed to use the standard library
#task 10
requires me to write a program tht prints a triangle
Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);

You can only use _putchar function to print

Where size is the size of the triangle

If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line

Use the character # to print the triangle
#task 11
requires me to write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143
#task 12
requires me to write a program that prints an integer
Prototype: void print_number(int n);

You can only use _putchar function to print

You are not allowed to use long

You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers

You are not allowed to hard-code special values
